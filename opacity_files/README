All opacities here are for graphite spherical dust

kappalam files are lambda [cm], kappa_abs [cm^2/g]
kappanu files are nu [Hz], kappa_abs [cm^2/g]

For the single size files:
c001 is for graphite with a size of 0.01 um
c005 is for graphite with a size of 0.05 um
c01 is for graphite with a size of 0.1 um
c05 is for graphite with a size of 0.5 um
c1 is for graphite with a size of 1.0 um

For the multiple-size files:

The minimum size is always 0.005 um. The size distribution is a^-3.5. The maximum size varies.

c001 is for graphite with the maximum size of 0.01 um
c005 is for graphite with the maximum size of 0.05 um
c01 is for graphite with the maximum size of 0.1 um
c025 is for graphite with the maximum size of 0.25 um
c05 is for graphite with the maximum size of 0.5 um
c1 is for graphite with the maximum size of 1.0 um
